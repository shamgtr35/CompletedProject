<p><b>
IT tools and systems used in productivity and effeciency for making the website is the greater strength to ensure the website is created on demand and it meets the requirements.

to do more then a bigger team will be required to paticipate in order to complete the work.</b></p>

- Testing is part of making sure the code works correctly, this involves saving and executing to run the code. Testing made sure that the code works correctly.
