    <br>
    <p>Doing it in teams would have involved more in depth work to be done as each team member will be identifying more and more and make it better looking. Working in a team would be good to do, depending on the size of the project. If it involves to do
        more then a bigger team will be required to paticipate in order to complete the work.</p>

    <br>
    <p>I have decided to go for a more hobbies and interests based looking website, starring my favourite cars as they are a huge passion of mine. So next time I create a website, I would go for a more business and perspective, giving it a more professional
        vibe. I would be keen to see how a group project of creating a website would look, with the use of Slack and communication to share code and to fuse ideas to one website, how each page would look in terms of each individual business ideas. However,
        I would create yet another individual project as I enjoyed challenging myself.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>When making changes and improvements to my digital project, I opened the website through a local host server and refreshed the page each time I made a change to see if it worked the way I wanted it to. I would repeat this process up until the project
        is complete, re-adjusting each image and body of text I apply, until it fits my liking.</p>
